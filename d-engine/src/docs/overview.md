# d-engine - Distributed Coordination Engine

**d-engine** is a lightweight distributed coordination engine written in Rust,
designed for embedding into applications that need strong consistency—the consensus
layer for building reliable distributed systems.

**Built with a simple vision**: make distributed coordination accessible - cheap
to run, simple to use. **Built on a core philosophy**: choose simple architectures
over complex ones.

d-engine's Raft core uses a single-threaded event loop to guarantee strong consistency
and strict ordering while keeping the codebase clean and performant. Production-ready
Raft implementation with flexible read consistency (Linearizable/Lease-Based/Eventual)
and pluggable storage backends. Start with one node, scale to a cluster when needed.

| Crate               | Purpose                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **d-engine-proto**  | Protocol definitions (Prost)    |

## Quick Start

### Embedded Mode (Rust)

```rust,ignore
use d_engine::prelude::*;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let engine = EmbeddedEngine::with_rocksdb("./data", None).await?;
    engine.wait_ready(std::time::Duration::from_secs(5)).await?;

    let client = engine.client();
    client.put(b"key".to_vec(), b"value".to_vec()).await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

```bash
cd examples/three-nodes-standalone
make start-cluster
```
