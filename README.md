**dengine** is a lightweight, strongly-consistent Raft engine designed to help developers build scalable and reliable distributed systems. It plans to provide a production-ready implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm, with support for pluggable storage backends, observability, and runtime flexibility.

---

## Features

- **Strong Consistency**: Full implementation of the Raft protocol for distributed consensus.
- **Pluggable Storage**: Supports custom storage backends (e.g., RocksDB, Sled, in-memory).
- **Observability**: Built-in metrics, structured logging, and distributed tracing.
- **Runtime Agnostic**: Works seamlessly with `tokio`.
- **Extensible Design**: Decouples business logic from the protocol layer for easy customization.

---

## Quick Start

### Installation

Add dengine to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
dengine = { git = "https://github.com/deventlab/dengine" }
```

## Basic Usage (Single-Node Mode)
use dengine::{RaftCore, MemoryStorage, Config};

```rust
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Initializing Shutdown Signal
    let (graceful_tx, graceful_rx) = watch::channel(());

    // Build Node
    let node = NodeBuilder::new(settings, graceful_rx)
        .build()
        .start_rpc_server()
        .await
        .ready()
        .expect("start node failed.");

    println!("Application started. Waiting for CTRL+C signal...");
    
    // Start Node
    node.run().await?;

    // Listen on Shutdown Signal
    // graceful_shutdown(graceful_tx, node).await?;

    println!("Exiting program.");
    Ok(())
}
```

Note: For production use, a minimum of 3 nodes is required to ensure fault tolerance.

## Core Concepts

### Data Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Leader
    participant Raft_Log as Raft Log
    participant Followers
    participant State_Machine as State Machine

    Client->>Leader: Propose("SET key=value")
    Leader->>Raft_Log: Append Entry (Uncommitted)
    Leader->>Followers: Replicate via AppendEntries RPC
    Followers-->>Leader: Acknowledge Receipt
    Leader->>Raft_Log: Mark Entry Committed
    Leader->>State_Machine: Apply Committed Entry
    State_Machine-->>Client: Return Result
```
## Architecture Principles

- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Error Handling Design Principles

## Key Components

### Protocol Core (src/core/)

- `election/`: Leader election and heartbeat management.
- `replication/`: Log replication pipeline with batch buffering and consistency guarantees.
- `raft_role/`: State transition handlers: (leader_state | follower_state | candidate_state)
- `commit_handler/`: Commit application pipeline with default/test implementations
- `state_machine_handler/`: State machine operation executors
- `timer/`: Critical timing components: "Election timeouts" and "Heartbeat intervals"

### Node Control Plane (src/node/)
- `builder.rs`: Type-safe node construction with configurable components
- `type_config/`: Generic type configurations for protocol extensibility
- `settings.rs`: Node configuration parameters and runtime tuning
- `errors.rs`: Unified error handling for node operations

### Storage Abstraction (src/storage/)
- `raft_log.rs`: Raft local log operation definitions.
- `sled_adapter/`: Storage implementations which is based on Sled DB
- `state_machine.rs`: State machine operation definitions

### Network Layer (src/network/)
- `grpc/`: gRPC implementation:
    - `grpc_transport.rs`: Network primitives
    - `grpc_raft_service.rs`: RPC service definitions
- `rpc_peer_channels.rs`: Peer-to-peer communication channels

### Observability

#### Key Metrics

```promql
# Commit Rate
count(count by (id, msg_id) (committed_log)) by (id)

# Write Latency
avg((log_commit_at - log_receive_at))
```

## Contribution Guide

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.65+
- Tokio runtime
- Protobuf compiler

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Build and test
cargo test --all-features
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D clippy::all
cargo fmt --check
```
## Code Style
Follow Rust community standards (rustfmt, clippy).
Write unit tests for all new features.

## FAQ

**Why are 3 nodes required?**
Raft requires a majority quorum (N/2 + 1) to achieve consensus. A 3-node cluster can tolerate 1 node failure.

**How do I customize storage?**
Implement the Storage trait and pass it to RaftCore::new.

**Is dengine production-ready?**
The current release (v0.0.1) focuses on correctness and reliability. Performance optimizations are planned for future releases.
