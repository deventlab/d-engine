//! RaftLog trait with explicit safety contracts and documentation
//!
//! This trait defines the interface for Raft log storage with comprehensive
//! safety guarantees. Implementers MUST adhere to all documented invariants
//! to maintain Raft consensus protocol correctness.
//!
//! Key Safety Properties (from Raft paper):
//! 1. Log Matching: If two logs contain an entry with same index and term, then logs are identical
//!    in all preceding entries
//! 2. Leader Append-Only: Leaders never overwrite or delete entries
//! 3. State Machine Safety: If a server has applied a log entry at a given index, no other server
//!    will ever apply a different log entry for that index
