//! The `StateMachineHandler` module provides a core component for managing both
//! write operations and read requests against the `StateMachine`.
//!
//! Snapshot related responbilities:
//! - Creating/Deleting temporary snapshot files
//! - Finalizing snapshot file naming and organization
//! - Version control of snapshots
//! - File system I/O operations for snapshots
//! - Handling file locks and concurrency control
//!
//! ## Relationship Between `StateMachineHandler` and `StateMachine`
//! The `StateMachineHandler` serves as the primary interface for interacting
//! with the `StateMachine`. Its dual responsibilities are:
//! 1. Applying committed log entries to the `StateMachine` to maintain state consistency
//! 2. Directly servicing client read requests through state machine queries
//!
//! While maintaining separation from the `StateMachine` itself, the handler
//! leverages the `StateMachine` trait for both state updates and read
//! operations. This design centralizes all state access points while preserving
//! separation of concerns.
//!
//! ## Design Recommendations
//! - **Customization Focus**: Developers should prioritize extending the `StateMachine`
//!   implementation rather than modifying the `StateMachineHandler`. The handler is intentionally
//!   generic and battle-tested, serving as:
//!   - Write coordinator for log application
//!   - Read router for direct state queries
//! - **State Access Unification**: All state access (both write and read) should flow through the
//!   handler to leverage:
//!   - Consistent concurrency control
//!   - Atomic visibility guarantees
//!   - Linearizable read optimizations
